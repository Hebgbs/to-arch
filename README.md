## How to use
Clone this repository and perform the following:
```
cd to-arch
make
./to-arch.sh
```

### This script assumes two things, which you should be sure of before attempting to use it:
1. You use GNU Coreutils. Every system this script targets has GNU coreutils, no reason why this shouldn't work.
2. You use _either_ Manjaro, EndeavourOS or Garuda.

I am not responsible if this script soomehow corrupts / deletes your `/home` because of some weirdness that occurs from prior experimentation around any of these distributions.

## Contributing

Patches / Pull Requests: Just make a PR and I'll test it. If it passes I'll commit it.

I have no idea about what i am doing, so I will probably have some friends contributing to this repository who know better than I about this script (and whether I should keep hssting it).
